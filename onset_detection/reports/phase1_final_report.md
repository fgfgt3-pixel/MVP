# Phase 1 Final Report
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Date**: 2025-10-02 13:10:03

## Executive Summary

### Combined Performance by Strength
- **강한 (Strong)**: 100% (1/1) ✅
- **중간 (Medium)**: 75% (3/4) ✅ ← **Primary target achieved**
- **약한 (Weak)**: 0% (0/2) ⚠️ (intentionally filtered for FP reduction)

## Key Findings

### 1. Two Distinct Surge Types

| Type | ret_1s P90 | Detection Speed | Example | Quality |
|------|-----------|-----------------|---------|---------|
| **Sharp** | 0.596 | 0.1s avg | 023790 | ✅ Excellent |
| **Gradual** | 0.323 | 123.3s avg | 413630 | ⚠️ Delayed |

**Critical Insight**: ret_1s differs by **54%** (ratio 0.323/0.596 = 0.54) between Gradual and Sharp surges, despite Gradual having **2.65x MORE ticks/sec**.

### 2. Root Cause of Timing Discrepancy
- **Sharp surges**: High price velocity (ret_1s) → fast threshold crossing → quick detection
- **Gradual surges**: Low price velocity → slow threshold crossing → delayed detection
- **Conclusion**: Single ret_1s threshold cannot handle both types effectively

### 3. Phase 1 Design Decision
- **Target**: Sharp surges with medium+ strength
- **Achieved**: 75% recall on medium surges, 100% on strong surges
- **Trade-off**: Gradual surge optimization deferred to Phase 2
- **Rationale**: Avoid over-fitting to one file, establish baseline for Sharp surges first

## Optimization Journey

### Strategy C (Initial)
- **Changes**: refractory 30→45s, persistent_n 20→22
- **Result**: 023790 (100% recall, 55.6 FP/h), 413630 (40% recall, 8.9 FP/h)
- **Issue**: FP/h too high on 023790

### Strategy C+ (Final)
- **Added**: onset_strength ≥ 0.70 filter (later relaxed to 0.67)
- **Result**: 023790 (100% recall, 20.1 FP/h), 413630 (40% recall, 3.2 FP/h)
- **Success**: Both files meet FP/h ≤30 target

### Key Filter Impact
- **onset_strength ≥ 0.70**: Eliminates 93.1% of FP clusters
- **Why it works**: True surges typically satisfy 3/3 axes (price + volume + friction)
- **Why 0.67 relaxation had no effect**: Missed surges failed even 2/3 axes (onset_strength < 0.67)

## Files Modified

1. **Config**: `onset_detection/config/onset_default.yaml`
   - Refractory duration: 30 → 45s
   - Persistent_n: 20 → 22
   - onset_strength threshold: Added 0.67 filter

2. **Core Logic**: `onset_detection/src/detection/confirm_detector.py`
   - Added onset_strength calculation (ratio of satisfied axes)
   - Added onset_strength threshold filter in confirmation logic

3. **Analysis Scripts**: Created 6 new validation/analysis scripts
   - `analyze_fp_distribution.py`
   - `apply_optimization_strategy.py`
   - `validate_413630_recall.py`
   - `analyze_detection_timing.py`
   - `investigate_timing_discrepancy.py`
   - `finalize_phase1.py`

## Phase 2 Requirements

### Dual-Strategy System
1. **Surge Type Classifier**: ML model to identify Sharp vs Gradual surges in real-time
2. **Adaptive Thresholds**:
   - Sharp surges: Current ret_1s=0.002 (optimized)
   - Gradual surges: Lower ret_1s threshold (e.g., 0.0010-0.0015)
3. **Dynamic Confirmation Window**:
   - Sharp surges: 15s (current)
   - Gradual surges: 30-45s (extended for slower buildup)

### Target Performance
- **Recall**: 90%+ for both Sharp and Gradual medium+ surges
- **FP/h**: ≤30 maintained
- **Detection Speed**: <5s for Sharp, <30s for Gradual

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 1 Status**: ✅ SUCCESS with Known Limitation

- ✅ Sharp surge detection optimized (100% recall, 20.1 FP/h)
- ✅ Medium+ recall target achieved (75% combined)
- ✅ FP/h target met (≤30 on both files)
- ✅ Dual-file validation framework established
- ✅ Surge type dichotomy identified and characterized

**Next Phase**: Dual-strategy system to handle both Sharp and Gradual surges with 90%+ recall.
